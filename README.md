**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

We will be working with different datasets about coffee. The main dataset is from https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-databasecontain and contains reviews of 1312 arabica and 28 robusta coffee beans from the Coffee Quality Institute's trained reviewers in January 2018. It contains features about the coffee quality, the beans characteristics and information about the production farms. The dataset already includes a cleaned version of the raw data, which anticipates the data preprocessing phase. 

To complement this dataset we will integrate the following smaller ones that treat the topic from another angle:
- **coffee_prices_historical**: 
The dataset contains records about coffee prices from 1973 to 2022
- **coffee_consumption_by_county**:
The dataset contains records about the worldwide consumption level of coffee in 2019
- **coffee_growing_countries**:
It contains description about the main coffee growing countries
- **coffee_producer_countries**: TODO Javier
It contains.

These datasets contain very simple data types mainly `integers` and thus don't require heavy pre-processing.

TODO add datasets sizes ?

### Problematic

Coffee is one of the most popular and widely consumed beverages in the world. Apart from its presesence in multiple gastronomic environments, it also symbolises a social phenomenom. Coffee accompanies the mornings of many people everyday and creates a good context of inspiration for countless individuals.

As daily coffee consumers, it is relevant for us to learn about the different varieties of coffee, and how the production and consumption patterns change due to different factors. Exploring the geographical, cultural, commercial and culinar aspects of coffee can be fascinating to understand and analyse.

Our work will revolve around the two most common coffee grades, namely Arabica and Robusta. They differ in their zone of harvest, their taste profile, but also their effect on the human body. Those insights will be a key part of our visualization, taking the shape of a visual comparative study.

Besides the study of varieties, we will produce a visualization of the coffee consumption accross countries, the principal coffee producers and the historical price of coffee along the years.

Regarding the target audience of our work, coffee is present in the life of people from different backgrounds and social status. This project is thus, for a major part, a source of inspiration for coffee lovers to understand better what characterizes this small little grain that changes their lives. As well as coffee producers, retailers and researchers to have an overall view of the distribution of features related to their economy or research like where coffee producers are concentrated and where it would be easy to find clients.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Analysis of the main dataset

The coffee-quality-database contains many different parameters describing the taste profile of arabica and robusta beans. To visualize how those characteristics coexist to make for a unique taste, we generated a heatmap of the correlation matrix in order to show correlations between, for example, sweetness and acidity.

### Related work

The originality of our project comes mainly from comparing the two famous coffee varieties: "Arabica" and "Robusta", as well as a worldwide overview of the distribution related to coffee production and comsumption in a more interactive manner.

While there are many available resources online analyzing different coffee roasts, they usually don't focus on the visual aspect of their study. 
Taking a visual approach can provide a more intuitive and holistic comparison of the two types of coffee beans.
In comparison, we can cite the work of
[https://rpubs.com/Aashu26698/coffee-review-viz](Aashutosh Sehgal and al.)

For instance, we have consulted an extensive work about coffee data along three Medium articles. The contributions mainly reside in the data analysis field, and plots are dense and technical. We . The first (https://towardsdatascience.com/a-review-of-coffee-data-grades-and-flavors-5ccb6fc51941) corresponds to coffee grade and flavor. It focuses on cupping scores (also known as Q-scores or grades).
